//Missing Function Call
- This line of code defeats the purpose of the void function that is meant to 
display the Fibonacci sequence, as the function call for displaying the sequence
is missing.

//Syntext Error
- The logic behind the reverse_string() function is correct and accurate, however, 
due to the misspelled function call(reverseString instead of reverse_string), this 
results to a syntex error.

//Invalid name of the function
- The name of a function is usually an action word which describe what the functio does,
and since the purpose of this function is clear, it should simply be an integer type. 
Other than that, the logic behind the function looks fine.
